Animation test for SDL2.0

Based heavily on Lazy Foo's tutorial on Animated sprites and vsync
Found here: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/14_animated_sprites_and_vsync/index.php
An exact copy of their example is located in a separate folder

Instructions/commands:
    make all
    ./main

This should take sprite sheets of any size as long as the single sprites are
square and the each sprite in the animation is the same size
