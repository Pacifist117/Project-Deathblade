# Initial Fun

This has largely been based on TwinkleBearDev's tutorial on SDL2.0.

I usually build this with:
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
	make install
	../bin/mainprogram

With this commit, the character floats around and bounces off walls. You can make him direct bounces by clicking and dragging anywhere on the map.
